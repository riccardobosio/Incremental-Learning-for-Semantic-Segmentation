# Semantic Segmentation in an Incremental Learning setting

In this project we developed a light architecture (IncrementalBiSeNet) that allows to perform Semantic Segmentation in Real Time.
Moreover, this Neural Network is tested in a challenging scenario: Incremental Learning.

The code is a modified version of: https://github.com/fcdl94/MiB provided by Cermelli Fabio.
